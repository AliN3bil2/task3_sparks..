Create decision tree classifier to feed data and predict it
Description:

In this project, I developed a machine learning model to classify iris flower species into three categories: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor,
and Iris-virginica using the famous Iris dataset. The project involved data preprocessing, model training, evaluation,
and visualization of decision trees.

Results:

Gini Criterion Decision Tree:

Test Accuracy: 96.67%
Classification Report:
Iris-setosa: Precision, Recall, F1-Score = 1.00
Iris-versicolor: Precision = 1.00, Recall = 0.92, F1-Score = 0.96
Iris-virginica: Precision = 0.91, Recall = 1.00, F1-Score = 0.95
Entropy Criterion Decision Tree:

Test Accuracy: 96.67%
Classification Report:
Iris-setosa: Precision, Recall, F1-Score = 1.00
Iris-versicolor: Precision = 1.00, Recall = 0.92, F1-Score = 0.96
Iris-virginica: Precision = 0.91, Recall = 1.00, F1-Score = 0.95
